Hello! I'm a recent college graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, currently pursueing a master's degree in the same field and I'm looking to start my career in software engineering with a full time position. I'm passionate about web application development and using frameworks such as React.JS with Javascript/Typescript and design frameworks such as MaterialUI. While I enjoy front-end work when it comes to an application stack, I want to gain more experience with fullstack and eventually become more profecient with both back and front end work. I also have experience with object orientated programming and using languages such as Java and C++.
