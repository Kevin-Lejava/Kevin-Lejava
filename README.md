Hi, my name is Kevin Lejava, I'm a Junior computer science student interested in learning more about and working in full stack web or mobile application development.
I have affinity towards front-end side work, using frameworks and libraries such as Node.JS, React.JS and Angular.JS which I am currently learning as part of a mobile applications course.
Recently coming out of the bootcamp portion of the Tech Talent Pipeline residency program I've become more eager to work in such a field and cannot wait to get my first internship.
I also have an interest in software engineering, being familiar with C++ and Java, but would love an opportunity to learn others such as Python and C#.
