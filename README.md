I'm a Senior computer science student interested in learning more about and working in software engineering and web application development with an affinity towards front-end side work, using frameworks and libraries such as Node.JS, React.JS and Angular.JS. Recently coming out of a bootcamp by the Tech Talent Pipeline residency program and going through an internship with The Driver's Cooperative, I've become more eager to work in such a field and cannot wait to get out in the field and begin my first real job in the industry. I am also familiar with C++ and Java, but would love an opportunity to learn others such as Python, C# and many other languages and frameworks!
